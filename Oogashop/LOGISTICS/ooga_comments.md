There is only one issue in log report that is on_update should have different message id but that on_update is not unsolicited and was sent in response to update call which has the same message id and no other API call has that message id. So we are unable to understand why message id in on_update should be different. 

If this should be different, please inform us or whizzard as this will be logistics provider issue.


Thanks and Regards
