 IGM Log Submission

We have submitted logs for all the flows as per the test case document but we are currently using Off-Network Logistics so cascading issues does not apply to us that's why for flow2 and flow3, we have submitted simple issue flow for delivery related issues which we will be resolving off network.

Please check our logs accordingly.


Thanks and Regards
